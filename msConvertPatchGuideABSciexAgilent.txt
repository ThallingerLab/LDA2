Guide how to replace AB Sciex/Agilent library files for correcting the license
----------------------------------------------------------------------

msconvert ist a part of the Proteowizard (pwiz) package.
msconvert as downloaded, does not translate the write the precursor mass
in an excat manner. The correct precursor m/z value is of utmost importance
for MS/MS analysis.

The required steps can be only performed in a Windows 7 operating system.
The reason is that Thermo libraries are only available under Windows.

The problem is that msconvert comes with dlls that are licensed for Proteo Wizard.
In order to correct this, follow the steps outlined below.

1) Follow the msConvertPatchGuide.txt until step 4) for 32-bit builds or step 2) for
   64-bit builds

2) The files that have to be exchanged are contained in the package, in the 7zip file
   at pwiz_aux/msrc/utility/vendor_api.7z; the problem is that the file is write protected.
   To extract the required libraries, start the compilation as outlined in step 5) and step 3)
   for the 64-bit and 32-bit build, respectively. Wait untile the line
   "Extracting vendor APIs ..." appears.
   As soon as the next line appears stop the build by pressing Ctrl+c

3) You can find the extracted vendor APIs at pwiz_aux/msrc/utility/vendor_api. Copy this folder
   to a different location (do not move it, since it contains other stuff as well, that is not
   contained in the vendor_api.7z).

4) Open the old vendor_api.7z (e.g. with WinRar), and delete in the folder that you copied
   under 3), all of the files, that are not in in the vendor_api.7z.

5) Replace in vendor_API/ABI/vc10 the DLLs with the ones from ABI. You can find them at
   \\majestix\Prj-LipidDataAnalyzer\ABSciex\WiffReaderSDK\WiffReaderSDK_beta-Assemblies-Revision1450-2013-07-12-1456.08\Bin

6) Edit vendor_API/ABI/vc10/LicenseKey.h and replace the entries corresponding to the license we received
   \\majestix\Prj-LipidDataAnalyzer\ABSciex\WiffReaderSDK\UniversityGraz_Beta Agreement_Redistributable_2014-12-11.license

7) Replace in vendor_API/Agilent_vc10_x86 all the files with the ones from Agilent. Attention: do not add any additional files (.tlb or .bat). The files are located at:
   \\majestix\Prj-LipidDataAnalyzer\Agilent\MHDAC\MHDAC_MIDAC_Package\MHDAC_32bit\bin

8) Replace in vendor_API/Agilent_vc10_x64 all the files with the ones from Agilent. Attention: do not add any additional files (.tlb or .bat). The files are located at:
   \\majestix\Prj-LipidDataAnalyzer\Agilent\MHDAC\MHDAC_MIDAC_Package\MHDAC_64bit\bin

9) Remove all files in the vendor_api\Waters folder and subdirectories, but do not remove the directories.

10) Remove all files in the vendor_api\Bruker folder and subdirectories, but do not remove the directories.

11) Pack this changed vendor_api folder as vendor_api.7z.

12) Replace the pwiz_aux/msrc/utility/vendor_api.7z with the one you created

13) Clean the build by excuting clean.bat

14) Restart the build as in 1) and follow the remaining instructions of the msConvertPatchGuide.txt

15) While the build is running you can check if the pwiz_aux/msrc/utility/vendor_api/ABI/vc10/LicenseKey.h
    contains our license
